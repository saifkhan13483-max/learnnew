Character Consistency Guide:

Teenage male protagonist: 17 years old, athletic lean build, fair skin with light tan, dark brown messy hair with waves, sharp grey-blue eyes, strong jawline with slight stubble, wearing dark grey hoodie, black jeans, white sneakers, silver watch on left wrist
Elderly male witness: Late 60s, thin frail build, pale weathered skin, white thinning hair, watery blue eyes, wrinkled frightened face, wearing brown cardigan over plaid shirt with grey pants
Scene 6 - Emergency Vehicle Approach:
The teenage protagonist crouches in a rain-soaked urban alley, looking back over his shoulder toward approaching emergency vehicles. Red and blue emergency lights reflect dynamically off wet brick walls, creating dramatic light streaks and color reflections. Heavy rain falls with visible droplets. The alley atmosphere shows trash bins and metal fire escape ladder. The protagonist's face shows conflict and mounting fear. Emergency vehicle headlights create dramatic backlighting from the alley entrance. Cinematic low-angle composition emphasizes tension.

Scene 7 - Unconscious Witness:
The elderly witness lies unconscious in the foreground of the rain-drenched alley, chest barely moving with shallow breathing. His black leather wallet with distinctive gold emblem lies on the wet ground beside him. The teenage protagonist is visible in the mid-ground, his expression showing shock and concern. Emergency lights continue to pulse red and blue on the brick walls. Rain creates surface reflections on the pavement. Dramatic lighting emphasizes the gravity of the moment. Wide-angle composition captures the full scene.

Scene 8 - Emergency Call:
Close-up of the protagonist's smartphone with cracked screen displaying "911" on the illuminated display. Emergency vehicle headlights approach from the alley entrance in the background, creating dramatic lens flare and backlighting. The protagonist's hand (in grey hoodie sleeve) holds the phone, fingers slightly trembling. Rain droplets are visible on the phone screen. Red and blue emergency lights reflect off the wet phone surface. Shallow depth of field keeps focus on the phone while showing approaching vehicles blurred in background.

Scene 9 - Heavy Rain Atmosphere:
Wider environmental shot of the urban alley as rain intensifies, falling in heavy visible streaks. Industrial trash bins, metal fire escape ladder, wet brick walls with graffiti tags, and puddles reflecting emergency lights create authentic urban decay atmosphere. The teenage protagonist stands in the mid-ground, taking in the scene, his dark grey hoodie soaked through. Emergency lights continue pulsing. Atmospheric perspective with rain creating depth. Moody cinematic lighting emphasizes isolation and danger.

Scene 10 - The Critical Transfer:
Intimate close-up focusing on hands: the elderly witness's weathered pale hand weakly pressing something small (a black USB drive with red stripe) into the teenage protagonist's open palm. Both hands are rain-wet with water droplets visible. The protagonist's hand (in grey hoodie sleeve) receives the object with fingers slightly trembling. Extreme shallow depth of field keeps hands in sharp focus while emergency lights blur in background. Dramatic side lighting emphasizes the significance of the exchange. Detail shows the USB drive's scratches and wear.
