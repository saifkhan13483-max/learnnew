Create a minimal animation of scene_1:

A 17-year-old athletic teen male (Jake Rivers) with dark brown messy hair, grey-blue eyes, fair skin with light tan, wearing a dark grey hoodie, black jeans, and white sneakers. He walks home along a wet urban street on a rainy evening.

Animation elements:
- Gentle walking cycle: Jake's subtle stride forward (loop every 2 seconds)
- Rain: Vertical light grey streaks falling continuously with slight diagonal angle
- Puddle reflections: Subtle shimmer and ripple effects on wet pavement
- Streetlights: Soft glow with occasional flicker
- Jake's hoodie: Slight fabric movement from wind
- Background depth: Parallax effect - buildings move slower than foreground

Style: 2D Semi-Realistic Cartoon Illustration
Duration: 3-5 second loop
Frame rate: 24fps
Movement: Slow, contemplative pace
Atmosphere: Moody evening with blue-grey color palette, dim lighting
Camera: Static medium shot following Jake's silhouette

Keep movements subtle and atmospheric - focus on rain, reflections, and Jake's steady walking rhythm to create mood rather than dramatic action.
