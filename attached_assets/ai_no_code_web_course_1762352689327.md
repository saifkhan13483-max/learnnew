- Static Websites
- Dynamic Websites
- Web Applications
- Forums & Communities
- Social Media Platforms
- Membership Websites
- Directory & Listing Websites

— without any coding knowledge, using modern development tools and AI agents.

The course must focus on essential, practical concepts only, giving learners just the right amount of knowledge to confidently plan, build, and deploy any type of site — while avoiding common technical or design errors.

Use this table as a reference for architecture and deployment recommendations:
