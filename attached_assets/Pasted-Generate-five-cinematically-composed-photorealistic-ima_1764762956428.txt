Medium shot showing Jake's tense body language and fearful expression. Background shows alley entrance with emergency vehicle headlights creating strong backlighting.

Close composition emphasizing the critical evidence. Wallet positioned prominently with dramatic lighting. Emotional tone: crucial decision point.

Scene 8 (scene_8.png):
Extreme close-up of Jake's smartphone with distinctive cracked screen displaying "911" on the dial screen. Emergency vehicle headlights approach from background, creating lens flare and backlighting. Jake's trembling hand holds phone in foreground. Screen glows brightly against dark rainy atmosphere. Raindrops visible on phone screen. Shallow depth of field blurs background emergency vehicles. Emotional tone: critical moment of choice.

Scene 9 (scene_9.png):
